## How to contribute to SQLTools

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/mtxr/vscode-sqltools/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.commtxrsvscode-sqltools/issues/new). Choose and follow the issue template to include as much relevant information as possible and or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change under GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/mtxr/vscode-sqltools/issues) and start writing code. Send a PR when finished.
